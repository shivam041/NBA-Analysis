# NBA-Analysis


Analyzed several csv files containing player stats and team stats throughout the last 20 years and analyzed how teams do compared to others. This final product allows me to see how not only teams do but certain players do and what they average verses other teams in the last 20 years. This project was created in a Jupyter notebook and used Pandas to create dataframes.
